**Important information: Following the acquisition of Snips by Sonos, the Snips Console is not available anymore after January 31, 2020. As such, we have exported all data of the English and German version of this app from the Snips Console and made these available in the directory [console](https://github.com/koenvervloesem/snips-app-supervisor/tree/master/console) with the same MIT license as the rest of this project. This project has been archived. If you're searching for an alternative to Snips, I believe that [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/) is currently the best choice for an offline open source voice assistant.**

With this [Snips](https://snips.ai/) app, you can reboot or shutdown the system Snips is running on, as well as restart Snips services.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this app is by adding the corresponding Snips app to your assistant in the [Snips Console](https://console.snips.ai):

*   English: [Supervisor](https://console.snips.ai/store/en/skill_l6qM1pVz2ez)
*   French: [Superviseur](https://console.snips.ai/store/fr/skill_BWAwo87MxrW)
*   German: [Supervisor](https://console.snips.ai/store/de/skill_px7A7V0Gzp1)
*   Spanish: [Supervisor](https://console.snips.ai/store/es/skill_n4lX48YApK7)

## Configuration

The app needs permission to reboot and shutdown your computer and to restart system services. If your system is a systemd-based Linux distribution, such as Raspbian or Ubuntu, you can give the app the needed permissions like this:

``` shell
sudo cp /var/lib/snips/skills/snips-app-supervisor/snips-app-supervisor.sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/snips-app-supervisor
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/snips-app-supervisor
```

The commands to reboot and shutdown your system and to restart Snips services can be changed in the parameters of this app: `reboot_command`, `shutdown_command` and `restart_service_command`. By default they are set up for a systemd-based Linux distribution.

By default the app asks for confirmation if you ask it to reboot or shutdown your system. This can be disabled in the app's parameters `reboot_confirm` and `shutdown_confirm`.

For disabling and enabling apps, the `snips-injection` service should be running, because the names of the installed apps are injected in the vocabulary of Snips.

## Usage

This app recognizes the following intents:

*   ConfirmReboot (only enabled after the Reboot intent is activated and the `reboot_confirm` parameter is set to true) - The user confirms that he wants to reboot the system.
*   ConfirmShutdown (only enabled after the Shutdown intent is activated and the `shutdown_confirm` parameter is set to true) - The user confirms that he wants to shutdown the system.
*   EnableApp - The user asks to enable a Snips app.
*   DisableApp - The user asks to disable a Snips app.
*   Reboot - The user asks to reboot the machine Snips is running on.
*   RestartService - The user asks to restart a Snips service or all Snips services.
*   Shutdown - The user asks to shutdown the machine Snips is running on.
